# osmolearn-dev-heroku

Feel free to try the app at http://osmolearn-dev.herokuapp.com/

<b>NOTE</b>: 

- Since this uses WebRTC, and this is on heroku site with no SSL certificates, this site is not secure and the video conferencing won't function simply because WebRTC requires a safe connection over https protocol for it to function properly. I highly recommend the HTTPS Everywhere chrome recommendation which you can add here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en. You can disable it or remove it from your chrome after you try it should you wish.
- You might experience some bugs, I had to put development on hiatus because of the start of the fall semester. I'll be ironing out those bugs and working on the UI to make it better overall over the summer.
